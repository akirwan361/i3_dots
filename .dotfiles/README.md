Dumping my configs for my i3 setup. No order. Only chaos.

## what I'm using

- [`**alacritty**`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - I don't know enough about terminal emulators to say anything useful
- [`**betterlockscreen**`](https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen) - it's real pretty
- [`**cava**`](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) - still sorting out issues with the colors and figuring out the ALSA/PulseAudio stuff
- [`**mpd**`](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD) - not that anyone would use my repo, but don't expect this to work for you without changes. My music is on an NFS share connected to my RPi
- [`**ncmpcpp**`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/ncmpcpp/) - terminal music player and it rules
- [`**neofetch**`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) - basic display for system info
- [`**neovim**`](https://neovim.io/) - soon I won't be able to use anything else. the plugins! [`deoplete`](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) and [`vimtex`](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) (with zathura; see below) are seriously a game-changer for coding and thesis work 
- [`**polybar**`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) - Very much a work in progress, but I've got few things I've frankensteined from better coders. Notably:
  - Power menu: gives a popup for powerdown/reboot options and it's pretty. Got the main code from [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) and I don't thing I really changed much. 
  - VPN display: pretty simple status display, can right/left click to connect/reconnect or show a terminal popup menu to select a new server. Cannibalized from [shervinsahba](https://github.com/shervinsahba/polybar-vpn-controller) (originally for Mullvad VPN)
- [`**ranger**`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) - pretty stock, still learning
- [`**rofi**`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) - who needs the XFCE whisker menu? it rules with polybar
- [`**wal/pywal**`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) - can't live without it, seriously
